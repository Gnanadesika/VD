1.DevOps Introduction
What is DevOps?
DevOps=Development+Operations	
It's a culture + set of practices + tools that help
	Developers(who write code)
	Operations(who deploy/manage systems)
Work together, instead of working in silos(individually)

Real time example

Imagine you are building a mobile app like Zomato
	The developer writes code to add "Track /my order" feature.
	Without DevOps: Developer givers code to ops team ->they mannually deploy ->bugs happen ->delays
	With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed -> customers get updates faster and safely


DevOps helps you:
	Release features fastly
	Fix bugs quickly
	Automate repetitive tasks
